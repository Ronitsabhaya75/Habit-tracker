SPrint week 4 Plans

My primary goal for Sprint 4 will be to improve customization and simplify user interaction by implementing more intelligent, data-driven features. By incorporating the user's activity history, I intend to improve the current daily check-in popup. This implies that the popup will be able to recommend pertinent activities depending on previous behavior; for instance, a user will be asked to pick up where they left off if they were actively playing chess the previous week. This will increase participation and improve the usability of the habit-tracking process. In addition, I'll be creating a profile popup that will appear in the upper right corner of the screen and use the user's uploaded photo as the interactive icon. When this symbol is clicked, a customized menu with more options relevant to the user's profile will open.  In order to further enhance the overall user experience and interface coherence, this functionality will be developed to allow real-time image updates and function uniformly across all user accounts.
