During Sprint 1, I made good improvements in our project's front-end development. 
My major accomplishments were creating the login and signup pages, as well as including a progress chart in the dashboard. 
The login/signup pages required careful consideration of UI aspects, and I made certain that the design was both visually appealing and functional. 
In addition, I worked on the progress chart, which uses the Recharts library to dynamically display user progress and color changes dependent on performance.
 
One of the primary issue in developing the login/signup page was making the container transparent while ensuring the text readability. 
Furthermore, setting up proper navigation between pages required to ensure smooth user experience.
On the dashboard page, designing the layout and determining the necessary components were critical tasks. 
Implementing the "New Habit" button for adding new habits.

Through this sprint, I gained valuable insights into using Recharts for data visualization. 
Learning how to integrate and customize charts for a better user experience was particularly useful. 
Additionally, I deepened my understanding of UI/UX design principles.

However, there are areas where I can improve. 
One major aspect is writing better comments in my code to enhance readability and maintainability. 
Additionally, I need to focus more on designing the user interface based on real user data to ensure a more personalized experience. 
Lastly, strengthening the authentication mechanism, particularly improving password security, is something I plan to address in the next sprint.

Overall, Sprint 1 is an ongoing learning experience that allows me to refine my front-end development skills.
Moving forward, I aim to enhance my code documentation.
