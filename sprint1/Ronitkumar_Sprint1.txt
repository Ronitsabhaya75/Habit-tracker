Sprint 1 Reflection

During this sprint, my primary contributions focused on the development of key JavaScript components that form the backbone of our application. Specifically, I implemented the spotsGame.js file, which handles the game logic for one of our core interactive features. Additionally, I developed the habitContext.js file, which establishes the context API framework for managing habit-related state throughout our application. These components were crucial in establishing the foundation for our application's functionality and user interaction flow.
Challenges Encountered
Throughout the sprint, I faced several challenges that required problem-solving and adaptation:

Integrating the Context API with our existing component structure proved more complex than anticipated, particularly when managing state across multiple nested components.
Debugging asynchronous operations in the spots game logic consumed significant time, especially ensuring proper event handling and state updates.
Balancing code readability with performance optimization created some technical debt that had to be addressed before completion.
I overcame these challenges by researching best practices, consulting documentation, and collaborating with team members through code reviews.

This sprint provided valuable learning opportunities that enhanced my technical skills and deepened my understanding of React's Context API for state management across components
Improved my ability to structure modular JavaScript components that are both maintainable and reusable
Gained experience in implementing game logic with JavaScript, including randomization and user interaction patterns
Enhanced my debugging skills for asynchronous operations and state management

Looking ahead to Sprint 2, I've identified several areas where I can improve Better time estimation for complex tasks to avoid last-minute rushes. More comprehensive documentation of my code to facilitate collaboration. Implementation of unit tests alongside development rather than after completion I plan to focus on implementing the spin-the-wheel game feature and developing a habit progress tracker that will provide users with visual feedback on their habit formation journey. These features will build upon the foundation established in Sprint 1 and further enhance user engagement with our application.
