In Sprint Week 1, I implemented the basic structure of game elements into our project's frontend the dashboard (Front End has been done by my teammate), to build a foundation for the gamification component. Despite making progress, I encountered so many issues that need to be addressed form my end like navigation buttons between game menus which aren't functioning properly, the post-login animation isn't triggering as I expected and the calendar option integration should be done cause its not popping up. due to the time constraints this week, I wasn't able to fully test these implementations, but I've developed a clear frame work for the gamification elements and the rewards system.

Looking ahead to Sprint 2, I am planning to complete a solid base structure by resolving the current functionality issues and also connecting the gaming activities to the calendar feature. This work will require adjustments to the existing code to ensure more smooth navigation and the proper triggering of the animations. Im also developing ideas for the additional gamification features that could enhance user engagement and motivation within our application for userss.

To be More Productive , I believe we ( my whole team) should organize a team meeting focused on integrating our separate components into a unified main file this week. This session would allow us to test the integrated system, identify improvement opportunities and establish individual integration responsibilities moving forward into week 2 and 3 .

After sprint Meet 2, each Team member will have clear direction on how to integrate their component with others work , which will significantly accelerate our development process and help us create our final product.

we got this!
