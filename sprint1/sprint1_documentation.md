### Summary of Accomplishments

During Sprint 1, Team contributions were primarily focused on front-end development, where we worked on several key features that form the foundation of our application. 
Our major accomplishments include:

1. **Development of Core JavaScript Components**:
   - **spotsGame.js**: Implemented the game logic for one of our core interactive features, ensuring smooth user interaction and state management.
   - **habitContext.js**: Established the Context API framework to manage habit-related state across the application, enabling seamless state sharing between nested components.

2. **UI/UX Enhancements**:
   - **Home Page Animations**: Improved the visual appeal of the home page with smooth animations and introduced a dark mode feature, enhancing user experience, especially for late-night users.
   - **Testimonials Section**: Added a testimonials section based on feedback to provide social proof, making the app more relatable and trustworthy.
   - **Calendar System**: Developed a robust calendar system for event tracking, ensuring responsiveness across devices and proper handling of user interactions.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Progress Chart**: Integrated the Recharts library to create dynamic progress charts on the dashboard, with color changes based on user performance.
   - **Visualization Components**: Implemented bar graphs and pie charts to display user data, optimizing performance through lazy loading to handle large datasets efficiently.

4. **Authentication and Navigation**:
   - **Login/Signup Pages**: Designed and implemented visually appealing and functional login/signup pages, ensuring proper navigation and a smooth user experience.
   - **Dashboard Layout**: Structured the dashboard layout and implemented the "New Habit" button for adding new habits, focusing on usability and accessibility.

### Challenges and Roadblocks

Throughout the sprint, several challenges were encountered and addressed:

1. **State Management with Context API**:
   - **Challenge**: Integrating the Context with our existing component structure was complex, especially when managing state across multiple nested components.
   - **Solution**: Researched best practices, consulted documentation, and collaborated with team members through code reviews to ensure proper implementation.

2. **Debugging Asynchronous Operations**:
   - **Challenge**: Debugging asynchronous operations in the spots game logic consumed significant time, particularly ensuring proper event handling and state updates.
   - **Solution**: Enhanced debugging skills and implemented thorough testing to ensure smooth functionality.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring the calendar system was responsive across different devices was frustrating, with frequent breakages on mobile devices.
   - **Solution**: Spent considerable time adjusting grid settings and testing on various devices to achieve consistent responsiveness.

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - **Challenge**: Performance issues with data visualization components, such as charts slowing down with real data.
   - **Solution**: Implemented lazy loading and optimized code to improve performance.

5. **UI/UX Design**:
   - **Challenge**: Balancing code readability with performance optimization created technical debt.
   - **Solution**: Addressed technical debt by refactoring code and improving documentation.
