Sprint 2 Reflection

Skills Gained
1. React Context API for global state management
2. About SVG and CSS animation for interactive UI.
3. Local storage for persistent user data.
4. Styled Components for Gamification techniques to improve user motivation

Looking Ahead
In upcoming Sprints I plan to add few more game components to further gamify the habit-building expierence.
Change the HabitProgressTracker to HabitChallengeTracker as there is already a breakthroughgame which looks similar to the habitprogresstracker.

Sprint Summary
In this Sprint I completed the habitprogresstracker and Spin Wheel in our habittracking application.
These features were developed with strong focus on interactivity and gamification which looks interesting for user to use the application.
I implemented a strong and comprehensive progress tracking system using react context API for centralized state management and local storage persistance
The tracker monitors user activity accross multiple habit categories, and award badges based on predefined tiers.
To enhance user engagement, I developed an interactive SpinWheel feture that offers randomized rewards.
This components uses SVG and CSS transforms for smooth rotation animations, with precise segment calculations to ensure fair reward distribution.
Managing complex state across components while maintaining synchronisation with local storage.
Fine-tuning SVE calculations for accurate wheel rotation and segment positioning.
These were addressed by refining context logic and iteratng through animation and math adjustments!
