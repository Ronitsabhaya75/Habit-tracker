During this sprint, I focused on implementing two key components of our habit-tracking application:
The HabitProgressTracker and the SpinWheel feature. For the HabitProgressTracker, I developed a comprehensive progress tracking system that includes a context API for state management,
local storage persistence, and a visually engaging UI. The tracker monitors user activity across different habit categories,
calculates progress percentages, and awards badges based on predefined reward tiers.
The SpinWheel component provides an interactive gamification element, offering random rewards to increase user engagement.
I implemented the wheel's rotation animation using SVG and CSS transforms, created segment calculations for accurate reward distribution,
and integrated this feature with our existing navigation structure.
Both components share a consistent cosmic-themed UI that aligns with our application's aesthetic, featuring animated stars, gradient overlays,
and glass-morphism effects that create an immersive user experience.

Challenges
The main challenge I encountered was handling the complex state management required for the habit tracking functionality.
Ensuring that progress, rewards, and activity logs remained synchronized across components while persisting to local storage required careful planning.
I addressed this by implementing a context-based architecture that centralizes state management logic.
Another difficulty was creating the spinning wheel animation with accurate segment positioning
The mathematical calculations for SVG paths and text placement required multiple iterations to get right,
especially ensuring that the winning segment was correctly identified after the wheel stopped spinning.

This sprint significantly enhanced my skills in:

React Context API for global state management
SVG manipulation for interactive components
CSS animations and keyframes for creating engaging UI elements
Local storage implementation for persistent user data
Styled-components for creating a cohesive design system

I also gained deeper insights into gamification principles and how they can be applied to encourage habit formation through reward systems and interactive elements.

In future sprints, I could improve my work by:

Adding unit tests for the context providers to ensure reliable state management
Implementing better mobile responsiveness for both components
Refactoring some redundant styled components into a shared UI library
Adding more customization options for users to personalize their experience
