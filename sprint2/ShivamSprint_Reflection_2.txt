Personal Reflection on sprint 2
In the previous sprint, I contributed significantly to the team's progress by implementing key features and improving the overall structure of our project. My main contributions included developing the authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login and registration, integrating Axios for API calls, and troubleshooting frontend-backend communication issues. Additionally, I played a role in debugging and optimizing some core React components, ensuring a smoother user experience.

One of the main challenges I encountered was resolving CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues when connecting the frontend to the backend. Initially, API requests from the React app to the Express server were blocked. I addressed this by configuring the backend with proper CORS settings using the cors middleware. Another challenge was a missing dependency issue (react-scripts and axios not being recognized), which I resolved by reinstalling dependencies and clearing the cache. Debugging these issues helped me gain a deeper understanding of dependency management and server-client interactions.

Throughout this sprint, I learned several valuable skills. First, I improved my debugging abilities by analyzing console logs and backend error messages efficiently. Second, I became more proficient in Express.js routing and handling middleware. I also strengthened my understanding of Git version control, especially working with feature branches and resolving merge conflicts when multiple team members pushed changes simultaneously.

While the sprint was productive, there is always room for improvement. One key area I could improve is better time management. Some tasks took longer than expected due to unforeseen issues, so planning extra buffer time in future sprints would help mitigate delays. Additionally, as a team, we could have improved our communication and documentationâ€”sometimes, teammates had trouble understanding certain implementations due to a lack of clear comments or documentation. Moving forward, we should aim to document key decisions and technical implementations more effectively.

For the next sprint, I plan to focus on writing more modular code to improve maintainability and enhance test coverage to catch issues earlier. Overall, this sprint was a great learning experience, and I look forward to applying these lessons to improve our workflow in the next phase.
