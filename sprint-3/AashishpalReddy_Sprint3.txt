During Sprint 3,
I focused on improving the user interface and experience by integrating a more interactive XP reward system, simplifying the codebase,
and enhancing engagement within the Habit Challenge App. Key changes included transforming the Spin Wheel into a modal-style popup and
removing a redundant feature component called HabitProgressTracker and added meaningful gameplay components that would motivate users to build habits while having fun.

Major Accomplishments
1) The HabitQuizGame was one of the main features built this sprint. It challenges users with three rounds of randomized habit-related multiple-choice questions.
Users earn 10 XP for each correct answer, and after each round, they spin the newly integrated SpinWheelPopup for bonus XP.
2) To centralize the XP challenge experience, I revamped the HabitChallengeCenter into a two-tab hub for Hourly Challenges and Weekly Challenges.
Users can earn XP by completing short tasks, choosing difficulty levels, or checking off daily habits over a week.
I used React state management to handle game logic, and styled-components to deliver a smooth UI.

My learnings-
Sprint 3 helped me gain deeper experience in building multi-step user interactions, managing React state and effects, and integrating reward mechanics like XP systems and modals.
I also improved my understanding of clean component design by removing unnecessary parts and focusing on reusability, user motivation, and responsive design.

Challenges faced-
While Sprint 3 was rewarding, it also came with its fair share of challenges. One of the trickiest parts was integrating the SpinWheelPopup into the HabitQuizGame
flow without disrupting the quiz logic. I had to carefully manage state variables like showSpinWheel and initialSpinDone to ensure the wheel appeared only at the right moments 
— once per round and only once per day — without overlapping with question transitions or resetting XP incorrectly. Designing games that were both fun and functional took time.
I wanted each game to not only entertain but also reinforce positive habits. That meant balancing difficulty, feedback, and user flow while keeping the UI clean and responsive.

Areas needed Improvement-
Although this sprint brought many exciting updates, there are still several areas that can be improved to make the overall experience smoother and more scalable.
I need to connect the games to the leaderboard where the users can check leaderboard stats immediately after completion of playing games.
I can even improve the interface and graphics of the games.
