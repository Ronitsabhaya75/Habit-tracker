Sprint 3 Summary
During Sprint 3, I focused on enhancing user interaction and engagement by implementing key features such as an AI-powered chatbot, Google authentication, real-time chess gameplay, and deeper integration between the leaderboard, tasks, and calendar.

Key Accomplishments:
AI Chatbot Integration

Successfully implemented an AI chatbot using the Gemini API, enabling users to interact with the system for task-related queries, game assistance, and general support.

Ensured smooth API communication and designed an intuitive chat interface for seamless user experience.

Google Login Authentication

Integrated Firebase Authentication to allow users to sign in via Google, improving security and simplifying the login process.

Configured Firebase properly to handle user sessions and data access securely.

Real-Time Chess Game

Developed a real-time multiplayer chess game, allowing users to challenge each other with live updates.

Managed game state synchronization and move validation to ensure a smooth gaming experience.

Leaderboard-Task-Calendar Integration

Connected the leaderboard with tasks and calendar events, rewarding users with points upon task completion.

Ensured real-time updates to the leaderboard to reflect user progress dynamically.

Challenges Faced:
Managing real-time data flow in the chess game required careful handling of WebSocket connections and state updates.

Integrating Firebase Auth with existing user data while maintaining consistency was initially complex.

Ensuring accurate point allocation between tasks, calendar events, and the leaderboard demanded precise backend logic.

Lessons Learned:
Improved my understanding of real-time applications (chess game, live leaderboard updates).

Gained hands-on experience with Firebase Auth and Gemini API integration.

Strengthened my skills in state management for dynamic, interconnected features.

Areas for Improvement:
Optimizing API calls to reduce latency in the AI chatbot responses.

Enhancing error handling in Firebase Auth for a smoother login experience.

Improving chess game performance by minimizing unnecessary re-renders.

Conclusion:
Sprint 3 was highly productive, introducing advanced features that significantly improved user interaction. Moving forward, I aim to refine performance, optimize API usage, and enhance real-time synchronization for an even smoother experience
